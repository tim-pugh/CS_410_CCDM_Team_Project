A CS410 (Cloud and Cluster Data Managment) team project to implement queries on CouchDB.

To run the queries you'll need a CouchDB instance running, modify the IP address of the queries, and obtain the username and password credentials, and load up the data using the xml to json parser.

You can get a instance hosted on Google Cloud Platform or create a instance on your own resources. We opted to deploy our instance on GCP and have the instance ready for deployment.

The username and password has been changed and has been archived for safe keeping, so the documented one will not work. As this was a simple class demo that used a VM that could be shutdown after a pre-recorded video, we opted not to obfuscate the credentials.
